# Assignment
Write a function that, given multiple number values given as parameters, returns the min value.

@[Min value of array]({"stubs": ["min.rb"], "command": "/bin/bash /project/target/run.sh"})

# Writing this

For this *really basic* POC I used `test-unit` to test the function written by the learner. The project folder of this course contains several files (markdown courses, unit tests, scripts) but I chose to only expose one ruby script to the learner to help them focus on the assignment.
You can choose to expose more files, and ask for more complex assignments. You can also create multiple code assignments by using the dedicated markdown command shown above.
